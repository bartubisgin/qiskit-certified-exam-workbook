# A Workbook for the Qiskit Developer Certification Exam
Hello everyone! This is Bartu, a fellow Qiskitter. I have recently taken the Certification exam and have followed the excellent study guide by James Weaver, which also goes over the sample exam, so make sure to check it out if you haven't already!

While following the guide, I wanted to re-create examples from all specified topics on my own in an organized way to make connections easier. After completing the exam and getting my badge, I thought, hey, why not make this public? Maybe someone else will also find it useful! So this is basically what this workbook is about and I do hope that you get something out of it.

I'd like to thank James Weaver and Saul Sarango for their invaluable feedback on the workbook and their encouraging words for making this public!
With that, I wish every disicple of Qiskit good luck on the exam!
